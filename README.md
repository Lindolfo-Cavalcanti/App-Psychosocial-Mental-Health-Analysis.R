# Psychosocial Analysis Shiny App

This Shiny app, **Mental Health Analysis**, is designed to facilitate the investigation of textual data from a psychosocial mental health analysis dataset. The dataset used in this application is hosted on Kaggle and has been uploaded and utilized in a new version to build this app.

#### App Features

- **Categorical Filtering**: The app allows users to filter the dataset based on different categorical variables, such as psychological problems and related categories.
- **Problem Description**: Once the user selects the relevant filters, the app displays detailed descriptions of the problems, including age and gender information of the respondents.

#### Objective

The primary objective of this app is to create a tool that facilitates the investigation of textual data and supports mixed-method analysis in the field of psychosocial health. By providing an easy-to-use interface, researchers can efficiently filter and examine specific data points to derive insights and conduct comprehensive analyses.

#### Data and Functionality

The dataset, `Cleaned Psychosocial Mental Health Analysis`, consists of cleaned version of the original dataset. The main diferences are:

1. Typo correction
2. Standardization
3. Qualitative Analysis of Categories

#### Implementation Details

The Shiny app uses the following libraries:
- `shiny`: For creating the interactive web application.
- `shinydashboard`: For the dashboard layout.
- `tidyverse`: For data manipulation and processing.

By leveraging this Shiny app, researchers can streamline the process of analyzing psychosocial data, making it easier to uncover meaningful insights and contribute to the field of mental health research.

Feel free to test it on your machine. Remember to change the paths and a recomend run the code line by line.
